## Immutability
* Once created cannot be changed
* Thread Safe
* Safe for use by other libraries
* String, Boolean, Integer and Boxed classes are immutable

### How can Immutability be achieved?
* class is final
* all the fields are final
* if Object are field then copy constructor/clone should be used on getters
